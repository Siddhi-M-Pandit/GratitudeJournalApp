## Gratitude Journal

This Flutter Android app allows user to maintain a gratitude journal by adding daily entries with:
- A 5-star rating system for the day
- Text-based reflections
- Image uploads via Camera or Gallery (Optional)

The user can view their past entries with formatted date & time, as all journal entries are stored in Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage, ensuring persistence across devices.
